This project is the result of a live C# tutorial stream I did on Twitch.

MinecraftServerLauncher was meant as a tutorial project to show-case a way of creating an application that can launch and monitor a Minecraft server.
I'm running and maintaining a couple of Minecraft servers at home and at times I forget to restart these servers. The goal of this project is to get a tool that can take care of keeping these servers running for me, while also making sure daily backups are made.
Time will tell which other features may find their way into this tool.

As videos become available I will update YouTube links here:

If you decide to use parts of or the entire project for commercial purposes, I ask that you at least credit me for my contribution.
